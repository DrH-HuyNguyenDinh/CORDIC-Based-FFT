## 📌 Overview
This repository contains the RTL implementation of a **1024-point Radix-2 Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)** processor using **IEEE 754 Single Precision Floating-Point** arithmetic.

Unlike traditional fixed-point implementations, this design provides a **high dynamic range** and eliminates common overflow issues associated with fixed-point FFTs. It utilizes a **Floating-Point CORDIC (COordinate Rotation DIgital Computer)** algorithm for twiddle factor multiplication, avoiding the need for massive floating-point hardware multipliers.

This project is part of my **Capstone Project 2** at [University Name].

## 🏗 Architecture

The design follows a **Pipelined Architecture** (Decimation-In-Time) consisting of 10 stages for a 1024-point FFT.

### Key Components:
1.  **Input Buffer (Ping-Pong RAM):**
    -   Handles continuous data streaming.
    -   Performs **Bit-Reversal** addressing to reorder input data.
    -   Stores 32-bit Floating-Point samples (Real & Imaginary).
2.  **Floating-Point Butterfly Unit:**
    -   Performs the core Radix-2 operations (`A ± B`) using floating-point adders/subtractors.
    -   Handles alignment and normalization stages.
3.  **Floating-Point CORDIC Rotator:**
    -   Operates in **Vector Rotation Mode** to perform complex multiplication.
    -   Accepts IEEE 754 inputs `(x, y)` and rotation angle `z`.
    -   Includes pre-processing/normalization to adapt standard CORDIC iterations to floating-point data.
4.  **Dual-Port RAMs:**
    -   Stores intermediate results between pipeline stages.
    -   Configured for 64-bit width (32-bit Real + 32-bit Imaginary) per address.
5.  **Address Generation Unit (AGU):**
    -   Calculates read/write addresses and ROM lookup indices for rotation angles.
